		<h2>
			A world vibrating with trust, sharing, love and interconnection
		</h2>

		
		<h3>
            <br>
            sharedearth.net is a social network for humans to build <strong>trust</strong> and <strong>share</strong> possessions and skills, helping us to coordinate our resources consciously, while contributing to the re-imagination of our cultural and economic stories to reflect our emerging experience of universal <strong>interconnection</strong>.
		</h3>

		



		<h2>
			How?
		</h2>

		<h3>
            By collectively making our possessions and skills available to others, we can become aware of the wealth of physical and intellectual capital we already have as a community.
		</h3>

		<h3>
            Through sharing we can develop behaviours of communal ownership and giving, breaking cultural patterns of individual ownership, ego-centric separation and exclusive property rights.
        </h3>

		<h3>
            Using the rich reputation information available on each member of the community we can consciously decide with whom we share, and in doing so, build a culture where actions of kindness and love are rewarded through deeper trust, greater collaboration and further sharing.
		</h3>
